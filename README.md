# Intel-Image-Classification-using-CNN-Model
I used kaggle notebook IDE for the corresponding kaggle dataset(Intel-Image-Classification)

# How to run
1) Upload notebook file
2) Add dataset in the portal IDE (Intel-Image-Classification)
3) Click the Runall button

# Hyperparameter Turning
1) Set batch size
2) Set optimizer and Loss functions
3) Set the learning rate corresponding model training accuracy

# Basic CNN Model 
First I tried custom model CNN architecture.
Accuracy:79%

# EfficientNetB7 Model
To extract more features implemented Efficientnetb7 architecture.
Accuracy:91.3%
